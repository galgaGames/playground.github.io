# How to contribute

Make a branch, do some code, commit the code, merge in into main. Done!
Easy!

# Have not used git before?

### No worries!

First off there are plenty of toutorials out there! if you dont bother watchign them, just start playing around with it, but i recomend using one of the git gui's out there like _gitkraken_, _gitdesktop_, _sourcetree_ or the one im using **sublime merge!** they help give you some overwiev of the git flow. and they are pretty easy to use!
but if ya wanna b like the cool kids and use the cli, go ahead. but remember! **_"the cool use cli, the lazy gui's and the smart does not care!"_**

### Got a merge conflict?

Many ways to solve this, if you are in a repo that have a _Gitler_ then ask him (he will hate you for doing wrong, ask him and save your tears)! Otherwise just merge the target branch into your own. and solve the conflicts. many git-gui's have built in methods for this! just point and click

# Linters!

### they are awesome!

linters makes your code prettier! which also happens to be the name of the best js linter, **_Prettier_** use it, you will love it!
