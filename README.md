# have not used git before?

### No worries!

First off there are plenty of toutorials out there! if you dont bother watchign them, just start playing around with it, but i recomend using one of the git gui's out there like _gitkraken_, _gitdesktop_, _sourcetree_ or the one im using **sublime merge!** they help give you some overwiev of the git flow. and they are pretty easy to use!
but if ya wanna b like the cool kids and use the cli, go ahead. but remember! **_"the cool use cli, the lazy gui's and the smart does not care!"_**
